The Celestial Bodies Management System is a relational database project designed to structure astronomical data, including planets, moons, stars, and constellations.
Developed at BMCC since February 3, this system leverages foreign keys to establish relationships between celestial entities, ensuring a well-organized and efficient database structure.
By executing complex SQL queries, users can retrieve detailed insights, such as listing all moons for a given planet or identifying stars within a specific constellation.
The project aims to provide a comprehensive and scalable solution for managing and analyzing astronomical data effectively.
